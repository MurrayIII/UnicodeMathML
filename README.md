# UnicodeMathML

*This repository provides a JavaScript-based translation of [UnicodeMath](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn28/) to [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) (hence "UnicodeMathML"). An interactive playground allows for experimentation with UnicodeMath's syntax and insight into the translation pipeline. UnicodeMathML can be easily integrated into arbitrary HTML or [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) documents.*

#### üéÆ Get familar with the syntax via [the playground](https://doersino.github.io/UnicodeMathML/playground/playground.html)!

#### üìë [Learn how to](#getting-started) integrate UnicodeMathML into your website or Markdeep document.

UnicodeMath is an **easy-to-read linear format** for mathematics initially developed as an input method and interchange representation for Microsoft Office. Its author, Murray Sargent III, has published a [*Unicode Technical Note*](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn28/) detailing the format, based on which this UnicodeMath to MathML translator was built. *More in the FAQ section below.*

![](docs/readme-images/1-hero.png)

*The initial development of UnicodeMathML was part of [my Master's thesis](docs/doersing-unicodemath-to-mathml.pdf).*


## Getting Started

For a **first look**, check out...

* ...the [UnicodeMathML playground](https://doersino.github.io/UnicodeMathML/playground/playground.html), an interactive environment that allows you to play around with UnicodeMath's syntax and its translation into MathML.
* ...an [example Markdeep document](https://doersino.github.io/UnicodeMathML/src/integration/example.md.html) whose source can be found [here](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/blob/master/src/integration/example.md.html).
* ...or an [example HTML document](https://doersino.github.io/UnicodeMathML/src/integration/example.html) whose source is located [here](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/blob/master/src/integration/example.html).

Depending on whether you'd like to write UnicodeMath in a Markdeep document or use UnicodeMathML on your website, there are two paths. But first:

1. **Clone this repository** or [download a ZIP](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/archive/master.zip).

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML.git
    ```

### HTML

Open `dist/example.html` in a text editor of your choice and scroll to the bottom. There, you'll see the following lines:

```html
<script>
    var unicodemathmlOptions = {
        resolveControlWords: true,
    };
</script>
<script src="unicodemathml.js"></script>
<script src="unicodemathml-parser.js"></script>
<script src="unicodemathml-integration.js"></script>
<script>
    document.body.onload = renderUnicodemath();
</script>
```

You'll need to **include the same lines (modulo path changes) at the bottom of your own HTML document** or website (but *before* the closing `</body>` tag).

* Of course, you can use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) or similar tools to combine and minify the JavaScript files.
* If you need to support [browsers that don't support MathML natively](https://caniuse.com/#search=mathml), you will also need to load a polyfill like [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) ‚Äì UnicodeMathML will notify MathJax when the generated MathML is ready to render.
* The `unicodemathmlOptions` variable allows you to tweak things a bit ‚Äì see the "Configuration" section below for more details.

### Markdeep

UnicodeMathML comes with a lightly modified variant of Markdeep that kicks off the translation at the correct point in the document rendering process. Open `dist/example.md.html` in a text editor of your choice and scroll to the bottom. There, you'll see the following lines:

```html
<script>
    var unicodemathmlOptions = {
        resolveControlWords: true,
    };
</script>
<script src="unicodemathml.js"></script>
<script src="unicodemathml-parser.js"></script>
<script src="unicodemathml-integration.js"></script>
<script src="markdeep-1.11.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Replace the Markdeep loading code at the bottom of your document with this code (modulo path changes).

* Markdeep will automatically load [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org), a polyfill that will allow [browsers that don't support MathML natively](https://caniuse.com/#search=mathml) to render the generate MathML.
* The `unicodemathmlOptions` variable allows you to tweak things a bit ‚Äì see the "Configuration" section below for more details.


### Node

While I haven't tested server-side translation of UnicodeMath into MathML, there shouldn't be any problems integrating the core of UnicodeMathML into a Node project ‚Äì it's all vanilla JavaScript. If you run into any trouble, don't hesistate to [file an issue](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/issues)!


### Configuration

The `unicodemathmlOptions` variable must be a **dictionary containing one or many of the key-value pairs described below**. If you're happy with the defaults, you can leave `unicodemathmlOptions` undefined.

```js
var unicodemathmlOptions = {

    // whether a progress meter should be shown in the bottom right of the
    // viewport during translation (you can probably disable this in most cases,
    // but it should remain enabled for large documents containing more than
    // 1000 UnicodeMath expressions where translation might take more than a
    // second or two)
    showProgress: true,

    // whether to resolve control words like "\alpha" to "Œ±", this also includes
    // unicode escapes like "\u1234"
    resolveControlWords: false,

    // a dictionary defining a number of custom control words, e.g.:
    // customControlWords: {'playground': 'ùêèùìÅùîûùö¢ùó¥ùëüùñîùìäùô£ùïï'},
    // which would make the control word "\playground" available ‚Äì this is handy
    // in documents where certain expressions or subexpressions are repeated
    // frequently
    customControlWords: undefined,

    // how to display double-struck symbols (which signify differentials,
    // imaginary numbers, etc.; see section 3.11 of the tech note):
    // "us-tech" (‚ÖÜ ‚Ü¶ ùëë), "us-patent" (‚ÖÜ ‚Ü¶ ‚ÖÜ), or "euro-tech" (‚ÖÜ ‚Ü¶ d)
    doubleStruckMode: "us-tech",

    // a function that will run before the translation is kicked off
    before: Function.prototype,

    // a function that will run after the translation has finished (and after
    // MathJax, if loaded, has been told to render the generated MathML)
    after: Function.prototype
};
```


## FAQ

Got **further questions** that aren't answered below, or ideas for **potential improvements**, or **found a bug**? *Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/issues)!*


### What's this *UnicodeMath* you're talking about?

UnicodeMath is a **linear format for mathematics** initially developed as an input method and interchange representation for Microsoft Office. Its author, Murray Sargent III, has published a [*Unicode Technical Note*](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn28/) (a copy of which is included at `docs/sargent-unicodemathml-tech-note.pdf`) describing its syntax and semantics. By using Unicode symbols in lieu of keywords wherever possible, it's **significantly more readable than alternative formats** in plain text:

![](docs/readme-images/2-example.png)

TODO more from thesis/presentation ‚Äì maybe refer to it outright


### How does its syntax compare to AsciiMath, LaTeX, and MathML?

Here's a table showing a few formulas as you'd write them in UnicodeMath, AsciiMath and LaTeX, along with rendering examples:

![](docs/readme-images/3-examples.png)

There are more subtleties as you get into the nitty-gritty, but you'll see that UnicodeMath consistently makes for the most readable plaintext. LaTeX, in contrast, is significantly more verbose ‚Äì but since it's been around forever, you might find it to be more versatile in practice.

To summarize, here's a totally-not-biased-and-super-scientific evaluation of these notations:

![](docs/readme-images/4-stars.png)


### Does UnicodeMath support colors, monospaced text and comments?

Not in its canonical form as described in Sargent's tech note ‚Äì in Section 1, he mentions that such properties should be delegated to a "higher layer", which is perfectly reasonable in GUI-based environments like Microsoft Office ‚Äì but there is not such layer in HTML/Markdeep.

To remedy this, UnicodeMathML supports a few non-standard constructs:

![](docs/readme-images/5-additions.png)

For your copy-and-pasting pleasure, that's `‚úé`, `‚òÅ`, `Ôøó`, `‚´∑`, and `‚´∑`.


### Alright, but I can't find any of these fancy Unicode symbols on my keyboard!

Nobody's keeping you from adapting [Tom Scott's emoji keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U) idea for math.

More realistically, there's a bunch of tooling and text editor plugins that can help out here:

* TODO sublime plugin (note this: https://github.com/mvoidex/UnicodeMath/issues/20)
* TODO other tools (see the ones torsten recommended, macos popup thingy, something for windows?)

Additially, you can configure UnicodeMathML to automatically translate keywords like `\infty` into their respective symbols before processing proper commences ‚Äì see the "Configuration" section above.


### Alright, that's not as big of a problem as I feared. What's *MathML*, then?

TODO explain


### Isn't browser support for MathML really lackluster?

Sort of ‚Äì according to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=mathml), native support for MathML is available for around 21% of users as of late 2020 as only Firefox and Safari currently support MathML.

However, Igalia [is working]() on adding MathML support to Chromium, which should push this number upwards quite significantly in the coming months or years.

All of this isn't really an issue: [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org), which you'd probably use to render LaTeX math on the web anyway, provides a polyfill for MathML rendering.


### But LaTeX seems more TODO widespread, usable, omnipresent., and KaTeX is so much faster than MathJax!

Can't argue with that ‚Äì which is why I've been experimenting with enabling UnicodeMathML to emit LaTeX code, too ‚Äì most but not all UnicodeMath features are supported at a basic level. You can take a look at the progress in the playground by enabling the "Enable EXPERIMENTAL LaTeX output" setting.

TODO file issue if you want me to actively work on this again


## Development

*This section is largely a reminder to myself and other potential contributors.*

UnicodeMathML is intentionally kept simple and doesn't have any dependencies beyond PEG.js ‚Äì that way, it's easier to maintain and extend.

* TODO simple architecture overview


### Local development

Depending on how your browser implementis its same-origin policy, you might not be able to serve the playground from the file system (i.e. with a URL like `file:///‚ãØ/UnicodeMathML/playground/playground.html`) during development:

* Safari seems to work fine.
* Firefox does, too, after you set the `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` key on the `about:config` page to `false`.
* Chrome is more restrictive and thus doesn't.

You can work around this by running a static web server that's serving the root directory of you local clone of this repository. Many programming environments, one of which is surely installed on your system, provide one-liners for this purpose ‚Äì see [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255). If you've got Python installed, simply run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and point your browser at `localhost:8000/playground/playground.html`.


### Bundling

The contents of `dist/` are generated as follows:

1. Run the bash script `utils/bundle.sh` from the root directory of this repository.
2. Open `utils/generate-parser.html` in any web browser (the caveats discussed in the "Local development" section above apply) and move the file that will be downloaded into `dist/`.
